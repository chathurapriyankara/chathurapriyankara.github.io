Welcome! I am a PhD student at Victoria University of Wellington's School of Engineering and Computer Science and a programming tutor at the Wellington ICT Graduate School. My current research interests include software engineering, programming education, software processes, human computer interaction, and mobile interaction. I received my B.Sc in information technology from the University of Moratuwa.
